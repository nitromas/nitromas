### Copyright rules on Contemporary Art
Copyright rules on Youtube has been one of the most tedious things for content creators.

Millions of false copyright claims have been made by Youtube in the past few years, and the main culprit of this is because songs such as contemporary art is within the public domain but the orchestras that make the music themselves have copyrighted their work.
Content strikes and demonitization has been happening countlessly for content creators. Videos have been flagged for just a milisecond of hearing "Bach"

## Solutions
To solve for this problem of false copyright claims, there must be some loopholes that can snake around these tacky laws on this copyright. Surely these songs must be accessbile to content creators to use in videos/livestreams. 
Some solutions that can be made to solve this could be:
- Playing the piece live with your own recording
- Using copyrighted music and paying for it
- Asking for permission from the orchestras to use the music
- Having your own composer create an orchestra and recreate the music with _trained proffessionals_.

# The Resolution
To create an end to these copyright strikes, the creators Ludwig and Schlatt have resolved this problem. They have spent tons of money in order to create a permanent solution. The 2 creators were able to hire professional musicians to create an orchestra and recreate some of the most popular contemporary music pieces. As a result, the people of the internet who want to use the copyright free music are free to do so without any problems as long as proper attributionsis given to them.
