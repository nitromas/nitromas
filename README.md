### Copyright rules on Contemporary Art
Copyright rules on Youtube has been one of the most tedious things for content creators.

Millions of false copyright claims have been made by Youtube in the past few years, and the main culprit of this is because songs such as contemporary art is within the public domain but the orchestras that make the music themselves have copyrighted their work.
Content strikes and demonitization has been happening countlessly for content creators. Videos have been flagged for just a milisecond of hearing "Bach"

## Solutions
To solve for this problem of false copyright claims, there must be some options that can snake around these tacky laws on this copyright. Surely these songs must be accessbile to content creators to use in videos/livestreams.
